PonziBar is the Automaten Bar that uses blockchain token system for access and governance. 
It is a concept project that represents automation and cryptoeconomics. 

It's main goals are:
- an experiment that prototypes different forms of automation and decentralised governance
- an experiment of a bar owned by a decentralised autonomous organisation
- an experiment where cryptoeconomic systems can be prototyped and tested, not just talked about
- a space where token based IOT systems can be prototyped an tested
- a space where IOT projects can be showcased
- a temporary autonomous zone for meetings of people interested in cryptoeconomics

What PonziBar's goals are not
- generate profit

Potential revenue that can be generated by PonziBar is re-invested into PonziBar
or distrubuted by catering staff as tips as a form of social welfare experiment

Roadmap:

Implementation of PonziBar starts with the least autonomy 
i.e. members able to access the bar and purchase drinks
for tokens or ether) and is directed towards higher degree of autonomy 
i.e.PonziBar hires it's own staff that cannot be 
automated out i.e. cleaners, stacking fridges with drinks delivered by 

MVP
- First bar in Berlin based on the concept of Automaten bar
- minimal token system that gives people access to the space and drinks
- install vending machines that accept Ether or Btc

Pre-alpha
- tokens are distributed amongst members
- test access and transfer of tokens
- vending machines accept PonziBar token
- legal entity that represents PonziBar and manages it's funds likely a cooperative

Alpha
- distribution system that allocates funds to be donated as tips to manned bar staff

Beta
- PonziBar automatically purchases services and products
- another bar is opened
